So to avoid the those mind bursting hassles, we can leverage this workaround.**_Let's begin,_**Modify your default Startup constructor as this,```public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, IHostingEnvironment env){	var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()       	.SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())	       .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)       	.AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true);	       builder.AddEnvironmentVariables();       	Configuration = builder.Build();}```In the above code snippet, the below line is an important factor that helps us to achieve our goal.```.AddJsonFile($"appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json", optional: true);```This helps to load the appsettings.json name dynamically.
